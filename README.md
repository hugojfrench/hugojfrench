# 👋 Hi, I'm Hugo Jorge French (@hugojfrench)

Junior web developer with a background in interdisciplinary sciences and a drive to build clean, purposeful software. After studying at UCL and managing a specialty coffee kiosk, I pivoted into tech through an intensive bootcamp—and haven’t looked back.

## 💻 Current Projects

⚽ **Draft FPL Tools** – Fantasy football companion for tracking stats, trades & league performance

## 🌱 Learning
