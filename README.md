# 👋 Hi, I'm Hugo Jorge French (@hugojfrench)

I'm a junior web developer with a background in interdisciplinary sciences and a strong drive to build clean, purposeful, and user-friendly software. After studying at UCL and managing a specialty coffee kiosk, I pivoted into tech through an intensive coding bootcamp—and haven't looked back.

## 💻 Currently Working On
🧠 **InspoForge** – an AI-powered idea generator to help creatives and entrepreneurs spark new projects. Built with Ruby on Rails, Hotwire, and OpenAI.

⚽ **Draft FPL Tools** – a fantasy football companion app focused on advanced stats, trade logic, and league tracking for Draft Fantasy Premier League.

## 🌱 Learning & Exploring
- Strengthening my **Ruby on Rails** skills by building full-stack apps from scratch
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable code using **Object-Oriented Programming** and **MVC principles**
- Diving deeper into **JavaScript** for interactivity and front-end logic
- Exploring how to use **APIs**, background jobs, and external services (like OpenAI) to build powerful features

## 🤝 Open to Collaborate On
- Side projects that help people do meaningful things, especially in education, mental health, or community-building
- Tools that combine creativity + utility (e.g. AI, music, or football-related)
- Anything that helps me level up as a developer 💪
